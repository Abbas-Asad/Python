There are four collection data types in Python:

List is a collection which is ordered, indexed and mutable. Allows duplicate members. [square brcs]
Tuple is a collection which is ordered, indexed and immutable. Allows duplicate members. (round brcs)(single tuple ,)
Set is a collection which is unordered, immutable, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and mutable. No duplicate members.

order aur mutable mtlb jo bhi hoga akhir may add hoga aur aur immutable to change ho hi nhi skta 

Lists are ordered, indexed, allows duplication and mutable (can be changed).
my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40]
my_list.append(50)   # Adds 50
my_list.remove(20)   # Removes 20


Tuples are ordered, indexed, allows duplication but immutable (can't be changed).
(tuple may crud wgera kay methods nhi lga skty)
